# Audvisa
Audio visualization app with python

## Dev
-   this app is still under dev.   
-   it can only show waveform of the sound and some basic animation.
-   next step ofc is to implement some juisy fft (fast fourier transform).

## How to run
```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python3 audvisa.py
```
u can change file_name variable to whatever sound u like

## Screenshots
-   if u are too lazy to run the app like me :o
